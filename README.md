# Cybersecurity-Awareness-and-Incident-Response

All while constantly improving my cybersecurity skills on various platforms such as TryHackMe and listening to various podcasts on the subject. I wanted to put my existing knowledge into practice and started looking for opportunities online. That's how I ended up at Udacity, where I participated in a programme for about 7 months.

During those 7 months, we worked on the following important topics related to the projects:

- Design a secure network architecture

- Set up continuous monitoring and alerts using a SIEM

- Create a Zero Trust Model

- Craft Endpoint security policies and hardening strategies

- Perform a threat assessment by doing threat modeling

- Protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data through concepts like encryption, auditing, file integrity, and backup strategies

## [Project 1 : Securing the Perimeter](Project 1 Securing the Perimeter)

### Project Scenario

XYZ is the premier cryptocurrency exchange. They transact over a billion trades everyday and are considered to be one of the most reliable and secure exchanges in the world. Due to their rapid growth, they've faced challenges in scaling their security posture.

The largest challenge they've faced is with their Perimeter Network Security being secure. The networking team was overburdened with the rapid growth and a majority of the network infrastructure was built insecurely.

Due to a lack of visibility and a lack of proper access control setup on the network, it was inevitable that a breach took place! XYZ was hit with a massive attack in which their network was breached and their internal servers were compromised resulting in over 500 Bitcoin being stolen!

Needing to get the bottom of this breach and resolving their current perimeter issues they've contracted you from SecureCorp, a world renowned cybersecurity consulting firm. Your job is to redesign their network architecture securely and set up a SIEM to monitor against future attacks.
